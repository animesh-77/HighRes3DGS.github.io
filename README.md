# High Resolution Novel view synthesis with 3DGS with a focus on humans subjects

This repository contains source code for the [HighRes3DGS website](https://animesh-77.github.io/HighRes3DGS.github.io/) which complements my Master's thesis in Machine Learning at University College London.


## Project overview

My research focuses on High-Resolution Novel View Synthesis using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. This website serves as an interactive supplement to my thesis, allowing viewers to explore the high-frequency details of synthesised views that are challenging to represent in a traditional PDF format.
